# Alzheimer-s-at-the-Cellular-Level-Integrative-Mapping-from-GWAS-SNPs-to-Gene-Expression
This study investigates the genetic underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by integrating Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We mapped genetic variants to specific brain cell types, revealing how these variants contribute to AD at a cellular level. Significant expression changes in astrocytes and microglia were linked with key genes such as APOE and SORL1, illuminating their roles in AD pathology. The application of LD pruning refined our analysis, ensuring the genetic associations identified were robust and independent. Through a novel analytical pipeline, we identified potential therapeutic targets, contributing to the personalized medicine approach in AD treatment. This research underlines the importance of cell-type-specific genetic expressions in understanding AD and sets the stage for future work to expand this analysis further, with plans to incorporate more comprehensive omics data to enrich our understanding of AD pathophysiology.
